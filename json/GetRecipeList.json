      "Description": "I came up with this recipe when I had some leftover canned tomatoes and decided to come up with a quick pasta sauce.  Normally I would have added basil to the sauce, but since I had some oregano on hand and I decided to use it instead.  I also threw in a few sundried tomatoes to sweeten the sauce a bit.  This is a quick and easy complete meal when served with a fresh green salad.",

It gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices. The old saying 'The closer the bone, the sweeter the meat' really is true. Leaving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness.",
